# Google-Play-vs-App-Store-Data
This project, which analyzes and compares mobile app data from the Google Play Store and the Apple Store, is geared towards a development team trying to figure which type of app to create next. The company is known for distributing their app on a "freemium" model - free to play with in-app purchases available to enhance the user experience. By having a better understanding of the two different marketplaces, the company will make a decision on which direction to take their newest endeavor.

## Background
This Notebook utilizes a pair of sample datasets from 2018. The steps taken are hopefully well-commented, and analysis and suggestions are included in the data exploration.I specifically avoided the use of Pandas here to practice basic Python functions and methodologies.
